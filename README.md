# My own Atom Editor Snippets

Author: Ronald Pereira (https://github.com/ronaldpereira/atom-snippets)

The file above contains my most used functions in C language, HTML and others. It works as auto completions on Atom Text Editor.

You can download Atom in this link (https://atom.io/)

HOW TO USE IT

Open Atom and go to the Menu -> Edit -> Snippets
Copy the entire content of my file and paste it into the atom snippets file
Save the snippets file
Enjoy it :)
